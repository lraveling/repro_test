- i also relied on this tutorial <https://happygitwithr.com/>
- try it with the "github first workflow"
- by using github first, you first create the repo on github, and then proceed with different usethis functions 
- this seems to be the easier way and can be combined with the tools from repro package after setting up the github repository 
- configure repository links between local and github as specified in chapter 15 of happy git with R
- check push and pull connections from command line: git remote -v
- create personal access tokens and verify with usethis 

## usage of Docker and Make 
- create a Docker Image with repro
```{r}
repro::automate()
```

- alter the makefile to specify the rule that creates your document 
- in my case, it was the rule from lines 7 and 8 in the Makefile, but it depends your own recipe
